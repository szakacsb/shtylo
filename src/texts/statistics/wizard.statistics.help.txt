The Statistics panel is about the type of analysis. Cluster Analysis produces a dendrogram, a hieararchical clustering. This should be used for most applications, with equal minimum and maximum MFW and Culling. MDS is Multidimensional Scaling, also for single iteration. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) has two options: covariance-based and correlation-based, the later is usually more reliable. tSNE stands for t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Consesnus Tree is for multiple Culling and MFW values, using a similar visualization to Cluster Analysis.
